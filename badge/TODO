TODO! things to figure out
--------------------------
0. FONTS - need 8bit font or otherwise.

1. Restore event hooks for: -- DONE

   radio
   touch
   key down events       
   orientation events

   ... in orchard-app.c 

2. UI-List UI wiedge

3. UI - Keyboard/passing of touch events, up/down selectors -- DONE

4. Name Entry -- DONE

5. FLASH STORAGE of LED, Name, and Stats  -- DONE
    -- dimming - store dim status in status/conf page
       
6. Game protocol and Game
   Restore event system first.

7. Launcher doesn't work. why? -- DONE
   (first app loaded is launcher but it comes up with a bogus number of apps.)

8. Game graphics ( can be done last ) -- in progress

9. TIMERS - reset the UI if it is stuck

10. Status / setup screen
    -- ability to show ID

11. Automatic jump to name page if not conf'd

12. ENTROPY - maybe use time of every touch to roll more entropy into
    the system, or an accel chip?

  if ( config reg is not set ) {
    jump to name entry app
  } else {
    jump to game
  }

13. App switching - I am fairly certain app switching is now functional because the dispatcher works. Needs test.  -- DONE

14. Our startup app is going to be the main app not the launcher. Launcher is secondary.

15. Splash screen spqr, whatever. -- DONE

HW NEEDS
-------------
1. Battery + charging, amperage testing

2. Board layout

3. Prototype #1


Screen
------

How do we get decent captouch? If we cannot, can we just give up and
do buttons?

A 4-button joystick and button would be better than this, maybe?
