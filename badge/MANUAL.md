Hardware Precautions
--------------------

WARNING! This device uses a Lithium-Ion Polymer Battery (LiPo.)

LiPo cells are affected by the same problems as other lithium-ion
cells. Overcharge, over-discharge, over-temperature, short circuit,
crush and nail penetration may all result in a catastrophic failure,
including the pouch rupturing, the electrolyte leaking, and
fire.

While we've gone through alot of trouble to protect you, don't be
stupid.  The LiPo cell present on this device has two levels of
protection. There is a protection circuit present on the battery
itself, and there is a low-dropoff / charging circuit on the board
which will turn off power if the LiPo drops too far down in voltage.

We have many additional LiPos available if you want to have a backup
battery. Ask for one!

Charging

By our estimates, the device should reach a full charge and read
4.2VDC in around 4-4.5 hours. 

Charge Lifetime

The battery should last in the 8-15 hour range, depending on LED
brightness setting and use. Battery draw is around a constant 60mA with
occasional bursts to 300mA or 450mA on SD card access.

You can increase the battery's lifetime by reducing the brightness in
the setup menu or by picking LED patterns that don't activate all of
the LEDs.
